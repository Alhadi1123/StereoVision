# Front View Obstacles Detection for Autonomous Cars Based on Stereo Vision  

## Overview  
This repository contains the research paper **"Front View Obstacles Detection for Autonomous Cars Based on Stereo Vision"**, conducted at **Manara University**. The project focuses on detecting obstacles in front of autonomous vehicles using **stereo vision**, aiming to distinguish between free drivable space and obstacles in varying road conditions.  

## Abstract  
Obstacle detection is a critical function in autonomous driving. This research explores **stereo vision-based** obstacle detection methods, comparing different **stereo matching algorithms** and introducing a **road removal approach** to enhance accuracy. The study is based on the **DrivingStereo dataset**, and the proposed method successfully isolates obstacles from the road surface.
